# Sidny Client

This is a proof-of-concept client for the SIDNY social network.


# Development

The project is written in ClojureScript using [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) and
[reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent).

To run it locally (and work on it) you will need to install [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure) and 
[node](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#installation-instructions).

To install additional libraries, change into the project directory and run:
`npm install`

To start a hot-loading development server run:
`npm run watch`

And then visit [localhost:8280](http://localhost:8280) to view the client.
